    Creates a text-based progress bar.

    This function generates a string that visually represents a progress bar, which can be used
    to indicate the progress of a task in a console application. The progress bar consists of a
    series of filled and unfilled characters, indicating the percentage of the task completed.

    Parameters:
    - percent (int): The completion percentage of the task. This should be a value
        between 0 and 100.
    - width (int, optional): The total width of the progress bar in characters. Defaults to 50.

    Returns:
    - str: A string representing the progress bar, including the current percentage.
